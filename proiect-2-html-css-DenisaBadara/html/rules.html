          <summary>Scoring in Handball</summary>
          <p>
            The objective for the players is to throw the ball into the goal.
            The team that scores the most goals in a match is declared the
            winner. The game can also end up in a tie. Handball goals often look
            spectacular. This is because players usually jump over the goal area
            line, thus ensuring they are not in contact with the goal area, and
            attempt to throw the ball in the goal while in the air.

          <summary>How to play Handball</summary>
          <p>
            Players can throw, catch, stop, push or hit the ball, by using their
            hands, head, torso, thighs and knees. They cannot touch the ball
            with their feet or with any part below the knee.
          </p>
          <p>
            Handball is a body-contact sport. Furthermore, attacking strategies
            are encouraged, while passive play leads to a warning and loss of
            possession for the team.

            the ball or inadvertently charged into an opponent.
          </p>

            unnecessary outbursts of violent physicality. A player or a coach
            receiving a red card is disqualified from the game.
          </p>
          <p>
            Players or coaches shown a blue card are disqualified and suspended
            for multiple subsequent games.Blue cards are only common in
            professional leagues and the Olympic Games.
